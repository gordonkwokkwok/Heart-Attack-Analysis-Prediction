## üìö Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis and prediction of heart attacks using a dataset containing various factors related to heart health. By exploring the dataset, applying machine learning techniques, and leveraging data analysis, the project aims to gain insights into the factors contributing to heart attacks and develop a predictive model. The findings can help in understanding the risk factors associated with heart attacks and potentially aid in identifying individuals at higher risk.

## üéØ Objective
1. Showcase the ETL process and feature engineering techniques.
2. Apply advanced Python functions and numpy operations for data transformation.
3. Visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn.
4. Apply machine learning techniques, specifically RandomForestClassifier, for heart attack prediction.

## Prerequisite
Creating a virtual environment is recommended for projects, and either venv or conda can be used based on personal preference. After creating the virtual environment, it is necessary to activate it before installing any required libraries. This project created a virtual environment called "cantekEnv"

### üîß Tool
- Jupyter Notebook (Version: 6.5.4)
- Python (Version: 3.9.6)
- Git (Version: 2.23.0)

Use following command to check version
```
jupyter notebook --version
python --version
git --version
```

### üìñ Library
Use following command to install the following libraries:
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install seaborn
pip3 install scikit-learn
```

## Command to run the project:
