## Prerequisite
Creating a virtual environment is recommended for projects, and either venv or conda can be used based on personal preference. After creating the virtual environment, it is necessary to activate it before installing any required libraries. This project created a virtual environment called "cantekEnv"

### 🔧 Tool
- Jupyter Notebook (Version: 6.5.4)
- Python (Version: 3.9.6)
- Git (Version: 2.23.0)

Use following command to check version
```
jupyter notebook --version
python --version
git --version
```

### 📖 Library
Use following command to install the following libraries:
```
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install matplotlib
```

## Command to run the project:
```
conda activate cantekEnv
jupyter notebook
```
